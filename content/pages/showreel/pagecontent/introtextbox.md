**Hey there!** My name is Jakob and I am a technical sound designer and software developer. I am passionate about creating engaging interactive software experiences and systems/tools of all kinds and forms!

Navigate to the _Work_ and _About_ page if you are interested in learning more about my journey with development and audio, up to now.

Feel free to reach out for a talk or for any questions - Iâ€™d be happy to hear from you! <span><ion-icon name="happy-outline" style="font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: -4px; margin-left: 2px"></ion-icon></span>
