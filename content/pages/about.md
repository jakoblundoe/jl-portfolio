As a sound designer and software developer I am highly passionate about designing and developing digital interactive experiences.

My experience includes work within the fields of sound design, digital design, software development, game development, scoring and music composition.

I am currently open to work and seeking a position, where these skills can be put to good use in the development of inspirational and meaningful products as well as digital experiences.
