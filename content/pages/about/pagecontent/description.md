I am highly passionate about creating immersive interactive experiences through sound.
I find the process of recording and designing sounds, as well as the development of interactive systems to implement the audio very enjoyable and rewarding.

I have experience in many different areas of sound design and audio-post, which includes: field and studio recording, dialogue edit, sound effect design and edit, foley, mixing and mastering. On top of that I have a strong foundation in the implementation process of audio in games and interactive software. Besides the middleware engines Wwise and Fmod I am also competent in the different software development processes. This covers programming in C# and JavaScript plus a general understanding of development environments, dependencies, version control, etc.

Lastly, I have an extensive background in electronic music and a strong foundation in music composition and production. A skill I find very helpful in the audio implementation process where sound, soundscapes and music connects in harmony.

Above all, I love solving problems and finding creative solutions in collaboration with the team. Game development is an interdisciplinary field after all, which I find truly exciting!
