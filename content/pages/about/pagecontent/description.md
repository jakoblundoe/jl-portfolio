I am highly passionate about creating and shaping immersive interactive experiences through sound. Both the process of recording and designing sounds, and the development of interactive systems to implement the audio I find very enjoyable and rewarding.

I have experience with the many different areas of sound design and audio-post which includes: field and studio recording, dialogue edit, SFX design and edit, foley, mixing and mastering. On top of that I have a strong foundation in the implementation process of audio in games and interactive software. Other than using the middleware engines Wwise and Fmod I have experience with software development processes. This includes programming skills in C# and JavaScript and a general understanding of development environments, dependencies, version control, etc.

Last, I have a background as an electronic musician and have a strong foundation in music composition and production. A skill I find very helpful in the audio implementation process where sound, soundscapes and music connects in harmony.

Above all I love solving problems and finding creative solutions in collaboration with the team.
The interdisciplinary field that is game development is an exciting one!
